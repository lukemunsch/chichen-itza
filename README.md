## Features

### Style Choices

        I have chosen to use a consistant format across the three pages of the site; 
        
        - background colour similar to the blue sky from the pictures taken of Chichén-Itzá, 
        - text and block element colors taken from the stone and building colors from the pictures,
           to keep it easy on the eyes without harsh color contrasts. 
        - the border style of outset creating the appearance of 'tiers' to the element similar to 
        the building style of the site that look like steps up the building.

### Hero Image + Overlay

        The image used at the top of the page is the famous Temple of Kukulkan; the Feathered 
        Serpent of Chichén-Itzá. This is the most famous building at the ruins and synonymous
        with Chichén-Itzá. This led me to use it as the responsive header image for the site 
        on all three pages.

        The overlay text is in a curvey style text in the same color as the body of the site.
        There is text shadow to help separate the writing from the similar color background as 
        the site becomes responsive and the text moves to different contracts against the background.
        The position of the writing as the site responds to viewport width requires the text to change
        size in order to not distort as much as possible.

### Nav bar

        The nav bar is linked to all three pages and is responsive to the size 
        of the viewport. With the order of links from higest relevance to lowest, this 
        set of links is positioned consistently in the same place - below the hero image 
        for the page - so it is easier to navigate the site.

        The nav bar will be responsive and as the viewport changes size the elements within it 
        will change to accomodate the smaller areas.

### Summary

        This is just a brief overview of the site, including the pronunciation of the name and 
        a quick factual statement regarding what Chichén-Itzá is as well as why it is being so 
        popular.

        Centralised text in temple structure style to keep consistant with the style for the Chichén-Itzá 
        site.

### Map + Aside

        This section is a text description of the map positioned aside the text.
        This pairing allows the user to see the location of Chichén-Itzá in relation to other 
        parts of Mexico
